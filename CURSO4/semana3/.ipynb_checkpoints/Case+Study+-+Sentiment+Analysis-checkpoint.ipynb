Ran it side by side with my daughters And it Ran just as fast.In most cases of downloaded faster And was never slower.I only wish this phone Was 1080p instead of 720pBut other than that I love everything about it. also i really cant tell unless it next to my other daughters samsung s6. I'm coming off of a HTC m8 Into this phone And couldn't be happier. I do not play a lot of games with the couple I have seem to do really well. The aesthetics, fit, and finish All seem to be on par With the two big Companies.(Samsung Apple). So far after 4 weeks I have not went Less than at least three days on a charge. And since it was a new toy the first few days with heavy use. The battery in this thing is unbelievable. Me personally, I'm not say What's most up-to-date snob. So the Android 4.4 is fine. However, I did see that there is the 5.0 update available for it Might try that out And perhaps repost afterwards.The sheer size of the phone is a bit cumbersome at first But Become second nature within days. I do love The six plus inch screen As I'm getting older my vision isnt as good as it used to be. To be honest I would be a little bit happier with say 5.5 in. screen. i was glad to see a few decent cases for this phone, which is another reason i assured myself to pick tgis phone up. the price certainly didnt hurt either. I have not yet experienced any forcestops or Force closes, nor Any glitches of any kind. It has been flawless thus far. Camera seems to do really wellWhen blowing them up on the computer.The external speaker is not quite as loud as I would like but I link my phone to a wireless speaker anyway so its no issue.Hope this has helped you some And I would highly recommend this phone to absolutely anybody. I am Excited About potentially switching the rest of the family to one of these and start saving me hundreds of dollars a year Because right now They all have $800 phones And this one works every bit as good as any of those in every way you can imagine except screen resolutionEDIT;Now on month 5 with the huawei ascend mate 2 and im on at&t network with it here in ohio. Nothing has changed at all with speed, dependability, and my happiness. There has been no glitches or hiccups of any kind. Im officially a Huawei customer for life. This phone has been fantastic. Reception on this device is betr then what i had on my samsung s5 or my htc one m7. I still havent tooken advantage of the dual sim card option, so i cant comment on that, but i will say that im a contractor in columbus ohio and can b quite rough on my devices but to my surprise this phone has taken a beating and not a problem one with functionallity. I have dropped it from 10 ft over concrete. It hit so hard that the case flew off and so far away it took a couple min to find it. Yes, it is scatched up, but works just as good as ever with no real damage to the screen. Dont get me wrong. This is not a ruggedized phone. Maybe i was lucky. Most likely its just a testiment to the build quality. Very impressed none the less.Again, i paid for this phone. I did not receive it for a review. Im a honest to goodness customer who shelled out 200 bucks for this and has been very happy for it. Hope this helps all of u.\",\n",

Front speakers are great and you can really tell the difference in sound when you turn the phone sideways and allow your ears to pick up the stereo effect.In regards to the camera, the automatic mode is great. However the maximum advertised resolution for both the front and back cameras is only achieved in 4:3, not 16:9 to match the wide screen, though 16:9 is available with slightly smaller resolutions.Battery life is great with stamina mode - after a full day of being connected to my Bluetooth and typical handful of calls and several texts though leaving Internet off, I got home at 5:30 with still 93% remaining!No overheating issues as some have mentioned - it was barely even warm after playing a graphically intense game for over 20 minutes +Overall very happy with this phone, and I have high hopes for durability.\",\n",

On the other side the standard headset could not be used at the same time with the charger, so if you plane to do this you will need the special headset for this purpose, and it is quite expensive. Another cons are the very low volume on the rear speaker: you could not hear a conversation and write a note. If you use the calendar option frecuently and you want the phone reminder you any event weekly, for example, it is a paine, because it did not have this function. You should copy the name of the event and change the date for every day you want it work, again and again....Something Sony Ericsson should do for improve, is to put some type of locking device, a button perharps, for the lens cover, so it will not slide in the wrong moment. Anyway compared with the Nokia N73 for example, wich is the closest competitor, the Sony Ericsson win, because has much better price. Vicente.',\n",

This little phone is very unobtrusive and fits in my pocket with room to spare. I can hardly feel it and even forget it's there. It's a full function smart phone. Everything a big phone has this little phone has too. The only thing I have an issue with is the size of the keyboard for typing. Too small for even the smallest fingers. You need one of those sticks (forget what you call them) that you can poke at your smart phone with to write. I use the speech to text option, which works good enough most of the time, but sometimes you need to use the keyboard. The number pad for phone calls is a very handy size and I have no issues at all with that. Phone calls are clear and there's no static ever. Very good there. I give it a 4 star rating because I have to charge it every night or it's dead by morning. I'm use to have an flip-phone that I could leave on for a week without charging, so the new smart phone could use some help in that area.

The Back, Home, and Tabbed buttons on the bottom of the phone have no light on them, so you can't see them in the dark. Even in the daytime, it's a challenge. I usually just kind of guess. I still manage okay, but like I said. An annoyance.Since I've gotten the phone, there have been a good 2-3 phone updates, which is great sinc eI've heard that BLU is bad with updating phones. The first iteration of the phone's software would not allow me to install a very important app to my work, but thankfully, after they updated the phone, this was no longer an issue. It's so great to see them ironing out the bugs. There were a few games that wouldn't install either but now that's in the past and I don't have any issues with installing apps anymore.Very recently though, I've had an issue with the phone's charging station and speaker. The phone is only charging when I apply pressure downward, which is not ideal. Additionally the speaker is clicking when it's making sounds. After a bit of research I've found that the speaker and charger port are the same part on the phone, so it probably needs to be replaced. I've just begun the process of contacting BLU's support. I will edit this review to see how quick the repair process is and if there are any issues.Repair Process:Day 2: No Answer from my contact request. Not even a automatic reply. I've sent another email request and if this one goes unanswered, I will call them tomorrow.All's said, this is a great phone and I would and have recommended it every time.\",\n",

For one, it has a metal frame, which sits very comfortably in the hands and gives it a solid feeling. It's certainly looks very nice, and if you've got a desire to have a phone with a stylish design, this one definitely fits the bill.On the downside, the display isn't quite as high res, it lacks an SD card slot for expandable storage, and it has a smaller, lower capacity battery compared to the S5. Thankfully, the lower resolution display still is very sharp, and you can still play videos at 720p resolution.

I looked for a small phone instead: something that could fit inside my beeper pocket in my jeans.This thing does, and does so _sideways_.Impossibly small, amazingly cute, totally functional. Cell signal is stronger than with my Samsung Note 3. Battery life is all day assuming you kill running apps, otherwise mine ran \"warm\" and the battery drained fairly quickly. I rooted it with kingroot (had to sideload via SD) and now have a perfectly functioning micro cell phone without any bloatware. I also installed setCPU and clocked it down to 800MHz to improve battery life.. OH, and install \"display brightness\" (looks like a light bulb) and turn on negative brightness to extend battery time even more. The thing is _amazingly_ bright.With these tweaks, the phone has remained at the same percentage for the last 2 hours. (most bloat can be killed with kingroot or frozen with titanium backup)I also installed APEX launcher, much slicker interface than stock.As noted, KEEP the charge cable handy, it\\'s non-standard and the plug-in part is \"longer\" than most cables you\\'re sure to have. I\\'m sure spares can be ordered on amazon.Bluetooth paired and worked perfectly as I listened to music for hours on a bike ride: sounded great.FULL 4G (well, technically 3.5G) speeds and wifi-hotspot capable (I used foxfi) . . . no complaints whatsoever on call quality / data speeds.The speaker is stunningly good for such a little critter.Netflix streams like butter and looks so impossibly cute.The screen is not high-rez, but does the job perfectly because of the tiny screen size.I am absolutely stunned that these are not more popular. Everyone I showed mine to wanted one. I can throw it in the back of my jersey and hit the road, or slip it in my beeper pocket and forget it. And if I need amazon prices while standing in walmart or a quick glance at the radar? Yep, perfect, fast. LOVE ITEDIT: after a normal day of calendar additions / phone calls /etc.. I went the full day and still had 82% battery.That number is slightly mis-leading as once you hit 14% you can watch it drain to zero and power off, Seriously, you can count the percentages down like they are seconds.Also, the rom has one problem on it, if you use a program to try and automatically change the ringtone (any program: like phone schedule or anything) it will crash whatever program was attempting to do it.

My warranty doesn't cover it. 130$ down the drain, considering most of the value was in the higher res screen.

With low tier software, a useless posh mobile app, any hardware specs are wasted. Purchase a phone that can be repaired, this is not a good deal.

The N97 fulfilled them (except for the size of the letters in the keypad where Nokia did it again - TOO SMALL for people above the 40!). It's nicely built, very powerful and rich in specifications so I guess it covers almost every possible need with its 3G, GPS, bluetooth, WiFi, qwerty keyboard, touchscreen, SD slot, excellent camera, etc but I am afraid I (or it) was not prepared to deal with too many technologies put together. The system is not fast enough to manage them all and probably because of my anxiety it had actually frozen and had to be restarted twice in one week using it. I also fail to recognize the logic behind the menu tree, probably my fault as well.I still have a lot to learn and explore, since, as I said, it's a very resourceful machine.

       " 'This review is for the 5.5\" Zenfone 3 Laser, since there seems to be some confusion about which product people are reviewing. I bought this phone to replace a Moto G 4G (XT1045). This phone is a great deal at the $200 price point, and I have not found any major issues with mine.- SoftwareBefore I received this phone I was ready to write off the stock ASUS apps as worthless bloatware, but I\\'m happy to have been proven wrong. There are actually some usefull apps included stock that were not included with my previous phone Moto G, such as a file manager, flashlight app, laser ruler, and sound recorder. The Mobile Manager app is actually useful for managing battery and performance, keeping other apps in check. The battery drain notification is especially useful since it can let you know about an offending app early, instead of suddenly finding that your battery is in the red and you have no idea why. I haven\\'t looked at any of the stock social or support apps yet. Some people have complained about wanting to remove stock apps, but I personally don\\'t see much point. They don\\'t auto-run so they aren\\'t using any battery, and with 32GB of internal storage + 128GB uSD I am not exactly short on space. Note that this phone does not appear to support \\'adoptable storage\\'. I\\'m not sure why they removed that feature from stock Marshmallow, but fortunately I didn\\'t plan on using it anyway.- UII wasn\\'t really sure what to expect from ZenUI having not been hands-on with an ASUS device before buying this one. Every vendor seems to be obsessed with differentiating through their UI, for better or worse. I figured worst case I could flash this phone over to Cyanogenmod in the near future if I hated the stock skin. However, I am happy to report that ZenUI looks and feels a lot like stock Android. People who are used to Samsung\\'s TouchWiz may not like it. After using the Moto G for 2 years I had no trouble at all switching to this. I like that the flashlight and calculator are accessible from the pulldown menu on the lock screen without having to enter my passcode. However, I baffled that Power Boost (kills backgrounded apps to save memory) and Auto-start Manager (controls which apps can auto-start) are also accessible in this manner, as these are not apps that I would want a stranger to mess with. That\\'s my only complaint about the UI.- BuildThis is my first phone >4.5\". I\\'m a fan of the larger screen when using it, but definitely not a fan of trying to bend over to pick things up while this is in my front pocket. With that said, the phone is very lightweight for its size. It is definitely lighter than my wife\\'s Moto G 3rd gen despite having a larger screen and higher capacity battery. That does give me some concern about long-term durability, but so far I have no had any issue. External case material is metal, though I suspect this is just a shell over plastic since it does not feel or sound solid when tapped on with a fingernail. The ends of the phone contain the antennas and are encased in plastic. I generally hate phone cases and do not use them, but in this case the phone is slippery enough that I opted for a low profile rubber case from CoverOn. I definitely recommend this case to add some protection without adding much size.- ScreenThe screen looks amazing. It is bright and sharp. 1920x1080 is absolutely enough pixels for a screen this size. I have no complaints about this aspect of the phone.- CameraThe camera is great compared my Moto G, although I guess that isn\\'t saying much. It\\'s not like I\\'m looking for a replacement for my SLR, so to be honest my expecations weren\\'t very high. I\\'ll upload a few photos at a later time, but I\\'m sure you can find many other sample images in reviews elsewhere.- SoundThe phone has a single speaker on the bottom end. It would have been nice to have a second speaker on the top end for stereo in landscape mode, but that\\'s asking a bit much for this price point. I see some reviewers have complained about it being quiet, but that has not been my experience. I keep my phone volume set 1 or 2 clicks up from silent and can easily hear it ringing on my desk from across the office at work. I suspect that those reviewers received defective units. The headphone jack, earpiece, and Bluetooth output are all in-line with what I experienced from my Moto G. I also have not had any trouble with lag during music playback like other users have reported. I use the phone every day to listen to music from the uSD card and it works great.My only complaint here is actually with the vibration; it is too subtle to work as a notification on its own. My Moto G would vibrate loudly enough that I didn\\'t really need a notification tone. With this phone that is not the case.That\\'s all that comes to mind for now. If I think of anything else, or if my experience changes significantly, then I will update my review accordingly.',\n",

Another complaint is that the 4 GB onboard memory is not sufficient. I have diabled all unused applications, move all data and aplpication to the SD Card (not able to move most applications), and I still do not have enough onboard memory to do basic things like update Google Chrome or update to the most recent version of Android.

I needed another cheap 5c so I got a green one from Cellular Trendz. Everything was fine except the battery life lasted a few hours even without me touching the phone. I am tech savvy and I\\'ve done numerous iPhone repairs myself so I bought a reputable battery here on Amazon. I opened the phone and I noticed one of the water damage indicators was red. Red= water damaged, white = never been exposed to water. I checked the other internal water damage indicator and it was also red. One of the screws that holds the battery connector in place was missing, but, it gets worse. There are RICE GRAINS inside the phone!! Not one or two random unidentifiable crumbs but multiple rice grains lodged in crevices of the phone. This leads me to believe someone water damaged the phone, removed the battery, and stuck it in rice.Good for a backup phone or someone who really wants an iPhone while on a budget. However, with the latest iOS 9 update this phone is slower than ever! Try and get one with iOS 8.4 or prior, but for long-term use I would go for a newer model.',\n",

The only thing is BLU phones do come with some bloatware, so I had to remove that. After that I installed Nova launcher on it as the stock launcher sucks. It doesn't have an app tray or anything. But that was an easy fix by installing Nova launcher. Overall good phone, I purchased this case (https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B01DEYYD5G/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2) for it. With a little modification with a knife it fits well. I've dropped it a couple of times and it seems to be okay, but I think that's because of the case. There's some negative reviews on here about it breaking quickly, but I'm not hard on my phone, so its standing up pretty well. The call quality is good and the speakers in it are loud. Overall not a bad phone for the price. Just be gentle with it and get a case for it and you should have no trouble with this phone.\",\n",
       " \"This is a review for the Asus Zenfone Laser 5.5 2 gig version. After checking reviews and questions answered I decided to try this phone out. In simple terms this is a remarkable phone. It is fast, highly responsive and i haven't noticed a single lag. So I will outline basically the various aspects of the phone briefly.BuildIt feels premium, and looks premium. It is light and very thin and thus I sometimes forget it is in my pocket. I haven't noticed any heating problems. The finger print sensor is easy to set up and is extremely fast and works how they said it would work. I took selfies tapping it flawlessly. Where the size makes it difficult for one handed use the software and the well placed buttons compensate.The screen is beautiful and it makes everything look a little bit nicer.With 2 gigs of ram and 32 gig of storage I have played games I otherwise would not have tried to play on a smart phone. N.O.V.A 3 plays without any lag and so does zombie reaper. So this is a safe device for playing action games keeping in mind the 2 gigs of ram.CameraThis is fast and snappy and the laser autofocus works as it should. I only had a few instances of blurred pics but that was when doing other things and switching back in low light setting. The pictures are beautiful and thought they may not be dslr standards, they are pretty good. The front and back camera take pictures of very good quality.SoftwareSome reviewers on youtube were griping about software but I actually rate the zenUI above samsungs touchwiz because of the amount of control it allows. Yes there are other apps aka bloatware but most have been useful in managing the phone and its systems and is way less intrusive that some similar and popular apps that would be downloaded in the googel store. It comes with built in app lock and a place to hide sensitive files. You can record calls without needing a separate app. In all I have found I hadn't the need to download most of my usual apps. The theme feature is a plus and you can even alter how you scroll though your homepage and how the apps are ordered. It is a Software that allows you to totally make your phone your own.FM RadioIt has a built in FM Radio that works very well.BatteryI would rate the battery as 4 out of 5. It lasts for the entire day with relatively heavy usage but based on what mode you put it in, it could last much longer.Speakers and Call qualityThe speakers are high but since they are mono speakers they obviously won't be as high as phones with dual speakers. The call quality was excellent and I had no trouble with the phone accepting my gsm sim or memory card.In Summary this is an awesome phone thus far and when using it you would think you have a phone that is much more expensive. I believe this is an excellent bang for your buck.\",\n",

       " 'I\\'ve had a N5 since launch. The N5 was a great phone for me other than the horrendous battery life. Fast forward to the present and I wanted even more screen real estate. I knew I wanted at least 5.5\", maybe even 6\". I just couldn\\'t justify spending north of $400+ for a N6, G4, S6, etc though. When the Idol went for sale for $180 on Amazon Prime Day I had to take the chance even though this phone was completely off my radar. The Idol 3 makes the Nexus 5 feel/look like old newsIdol 3 as compared to the Nexus 5:**Screen**The screen is just as good as the N5, I\\'d say even better as there isn\\'t horrendous white light bleed along the edge at extreme viewing angels. The extra half inch really makes a difference in media consumption.**Battery**Oh wow! It\\'s nice to have a battery again!I had a QI wireless charger for my N5 at work. Probably a good thing too or I would have sold my N5 a long time ago as we all know the battery blows on the N5. While I\\'d prefer that the Idol had wireless charging ability, I can live without it as I can easily get 2 days of use. It\\'s so odd looking at the battery percentage and not see it drop like a rock during the day. I need to look into aftermarket wireless micro usb charger + case to conceal it. Hopefully I can find the thinnest most \"stock\" looking combo.**Speakers**The speakers? OMFGBBQ!!! I sometimes listened to the N5 streaming music on it\\'s lone speaker when working on projects. It provided fill and it passed the time. The Idol\\'s speakers are exponentially better. Heck I don\\'t even think I\\'ve had them over 3/4 volume. I don\\'t think I can buy another phone that DOESN\\'T have two forward facing speakers now. I\\'m spoiled now.**Performance**Feels on par with my N5. Yeah I see a stutter here and there when loading a page or what not but it\\'s in no way a deal breaker for me.**Reception**I\\'m on TMO\\'s $30 5gb prepaid plan and I get crap for cellular reception in my house. Luckily I get LTE @ my work. So I\\'ve completely converted to Google Hangouts VOIP. I use wifi @ home for calls, LTE data while I\\'m away from the house. After a week things have been great so far for my coverage and use.**Feel**Lighter, thinner than the N5. Only con is the Idol is a slippery sob! I really have to mind my Ps and Qs when handling it. I like my phones to be naked as I don\\'t like the bulk. However I think I\\'ll have to just bite the bullet and get a case for this, not only for the wireless charging listed above, but for grip as well as protection cause yeah I don\\'t think the Idol is gonna take well to abuse :(**Conclusion**Well I was able to sell my N5 for $180 on CL in a day. Since I basically stole the Idol for $180 from that Amazon sale I got a GREAT upgrade for free :) I\\'m a happy camper.Now that the boot-loader is unlocked on the Idol I\\'m anxiously awaiting how performance will increase with a custom rom.

The only downside of the phone is the battery, it isn't extremely terrible but switching from an iPhone that could last me 2 days minimum is kind of rough, My HTC One lasts me almost a day unless im really using it. It also has a powersaver feature that I have used a few times but I have only put it on when im using the phone a lot, it saves a few percent by conserving CPU Power, reducing screen brightness, turning off vibration, putting your data connection to sleep when the screen is off.

This is just a review done by someone very pleased with her purchase :-)I had never heard of the brand \"verykool\" before, so I was really wary of it being some scam artist company.

I love it!At first, I was worried that the brand wouldn\\'t work with nor handle Android specifications, but it does. I have a Samsung Galaxy Tab, and I feel right at home using this phone.PROS-The price: Very affordable!!! Especially for people like me who drop my phone a lot. For the cost of fixing your screen ($100 something, depending), you might as well just buy a new \"verykool\" phone.-The screen size: Comparable with the iPhone 6 or whatever those big screen phones are these days.-Color, weight, and look: It\\'s sleek and chic. Unless someone asked me, they would not be able to guess how little I paid. This phone looks expensive! So anyone wanting an iPhone 6 dupe should consider this phone.-Gorilla glass screen and free phone case with purchase: I\\'m really clumsy, so this is a huge plus.-Ability to operate on Android software: Everything that is used on Android phones is available here. Don\\'t let the brand name dissuade you. This is comparable to the features of my Samsung Galaxy Tab.CONS-Picture quality: If you are a hardcore selfie person (I\\'m not), you will be very disappointed in how the picture quality turns out. It\\'s a running gag about Android photo quality vs iPhone photo quality, but like the gag explains, the pictures will come out looking like paintings. There is not much sharpness. It does have a plethora of photo editing tools, but they don\\'t really help with sharpness and clarity.-Bluetooth: It says it can\\'t connect to my blue tooth headphones, but I\\'m sure that\\'s fixable.Other than the few cons I\\'ve encountered, this phone is great! I feel so smart for buying this phone while people are dishing out $800 for a certain other phone.Parents, if your teen is whining about wanting the iPhone 6, and you can\\'t trust them with something that pricey, get them this.

You can update it to Android Marshmallow out of the box.It's surprisingly manageable, for the size, also, and I've found the battery life to be perfectly acceptable, if not amazing. It's better than the 1st gen Moto X it replaced. Also, it charges super fast (unlike Oneplus 2, which has no fast charging, despite its fancy USB C port...). The home button doubling as a notification light is also nice, in my opinion- a pleasant surprise. The software is almost stock Android, with some minor changes.The camera is quite nice. It doesn't always take great indoor shoes, but Bokeh mode is very fun, and looks great, in my opinion. While I wish it had OIS, the camera software is quite robust. There are a ton of settings that you can tweak.Heat has not been a problem (despite the 810s reputation). Especially with a cover on it, I'm not even noticing it getting warm under normal use.Only negatives so far: The top speaker (the one that you put up to your ear) has the cutout on the right side of the phone, meaning that, if you center the earpiece on your ear, the sound is low. You have to put the right side up to your ear to hear clearly when holding in your right hand, and vice versa. For someone who wears glasses, it means that the phone bumps into them when in my right hand, which is a minor annoyance.Also, I wish the camera button was two-stage, so that it would refocus on demand. (Still, a double tap launches the camera, and the automatic focus is pretty quick, so that's something).Lastly, there are some minor software annoyances. The clock has the appearance of stock Android, but it's baked into their weather/clock widget, and seems to be stuck at version 3.1. I just disabled it and installed the Google one from the Play Store, as I prefer to use WeatherBug anyway. Also, the notification light wasn't enabled by default, so I had to search for the setting to turn it on.There are other things that I could count as negatives but, given the price, I think they're acceptable (no fingerprint scanner, no SD card slot). To me, the Oneplus 2 loses to this phone at this price, due to the lack of QHD screen, fast charging and NFC, as I believe phones for payments will only become more common over the next year.\",\n",

Most of the other reviews haven spoken about the keyboard etc. So I won't rehash those but I must say I expected a bit more from the battery given its size. I currently get 15-20 hrs with mixed use.

Video is dark, slightly distorted and pic quality (zoomed in) becomes blurry. The other, the back cover, comes off the phone so easy. If you drop the phone, chances are the cover will come off. I actually dropped my phone, the back cover came off, and upon impact my battery fell out and broke. Otherwise, a great phone. And, for the price, you can't beat it.\",\n",
